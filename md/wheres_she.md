# Where's She?

A lonely tower hunches o’er  
A sweep of endless woods;  
Within, he stood amidst his books,  
A Wizard yet in youth.  

‘She’s gentle like the early Dawn,  
And like the Moon so bright;  
Bringest to me this forest fawn,  
Ye wisps and playful sprites!  

Bear this spell to an elven miss,  
A witch, or faerie queene;  
And bid them, with the sweetest kiss,  
*Wish she be my Helene?*’
