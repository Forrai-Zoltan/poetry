# Where's She?

A lonely tower hunches o’er  
a sweep of endless woods,  
Within, he stood amidst his books,  
a Wizard yet in youth.  

‘She’s gentle like the early Dawn,  
and like the Moon so bright;  
Bringest to me this forest fawn,  
ye wisps and playful sprites!  

Bear this spell to an elven miss,  
A witch, or faerie queene.  
And bid them, with the sweetest kiss,  
Wish she be, my Helene?’
